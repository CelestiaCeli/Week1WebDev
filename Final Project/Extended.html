    <h1>Salutations!</h1>
    <p> While an extended menu to look at all my previous works may sound good on paper, 
    It's simply too overscoped for a project like this. <br> I'd prefer actually work on this 
    when I eventually get to trying to set up a genuine portfolio out of this. Right now 
    it's focused on my main portfolio assignment, not my history. This is not relevant to my assignment. <br>
    You can ignore this, this is for future proofing. (pretty please?? :])</p>
